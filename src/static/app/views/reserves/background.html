                Parks serve a vital role for protecting biodiversity, yet limited knowledge about species geographic distributions constrains evaluating their performance and identifying conservation gaps.

                Map of Life is a global resource for biodiversity mapping and monitoring. A set of pre-released examples illustrate a new service, powered by Google Earth Engine, that taps into a vast biodiversity data store and high-resolution habitat information to pinpoint suitable species locations in unprecedented detail. This allows a transparent, interactive assessment of species potential representation in reserves.

                The highlighted species flag the much diminished range size and large conservation gaps remaining, especially in habitat specialists. Follow Map of Life and provide feedback as we expand this tool in the near future.
